# Customer-Resource-Management-Database-Project

This is code for a project I completed as part of the CS-314: Database Systems course at Illinois Wesleyan University during the spring 2019 semester. It is a simple customer Resource Management application using PHP and SQL to both construct a database and manipulate that database as appropriate, retrieving, adding, and deleting information from various tables as needed.

crm.php: A simple login page. Here, the user may type in a username and password, and this data is validated through the table of usernames and passwords for the application.

home.php: The homepage for the application pulls relevant info about users, their orders, and quotes from the databasefor display to the currently logged in user.

From the home page, a user can create a quote, add information about a new contact, and manage orders and shipments.
